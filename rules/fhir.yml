# Very early stages of implementing a bunch of FHIR rules:
#
#   http://hl7.org/fhir/http.html#general

# "FHIR is described as a 'RESTful' specification based on common industry level
#  use of the term REST. In practice, FHIR only supports Level 2 of the REST
#  Maturity model as part of the core specification, though full Level 3
#  conformance is possible through the use of extensions. Because FHIR is a
#  standard, it relies on the standardization of resource structures and
#  interfaces. This may be considered a violation of REST principles but is key to
#  ensuring consistent interoperability across diverse systems."
