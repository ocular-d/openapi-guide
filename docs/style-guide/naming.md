# Naming

## To do

- Add examples of naming

Naming conventions
To provide consistent developer experience across many APIs and over a long period of time, all names used by an API should be:

- "Simple"
- Intuitive
- Consistent

This includes names of interfaces, resources, collections, methods, and messages.

Since many developers are not native English speakers, one goal of these naming conventions is to ensure that the majority of developers can easily understand an API.
It does this by encouraging the use of a simple, consistent, and small vocabulary when naming methods and resources.

Commonly accepted short forms or abbreviations of long words may be used for brevity.
For example, API is preferred over Application Programming Interface.

Use intuitive, familiar terminology where possible.
For example, when describing removing (and destroying) a resource, delete is preferred over erase.

Use the same name or term for the same concept, including for concepts shared across APIs.

Avoid name overloading. Use different names for different concepts.

Carefully consider use of names that may conflict with keywords in common programming languages. Such names may be used but will likely trigger additional scrutiny during API review. Use them judiciously and sparingly.


## General Naming Rules

- Use American English
- Don't use acronyms
Use `camelCase` unless stated otherwise

(Add here posting from Handyman, should be plural)

Every identifier MUST be in American English and written in lowercase. An identifier SHOULD NOT contain acronyms. CamelCase (camelCase) MUST be used to delimit combined words.

## Vocabulary
Use web and industry standards where they make sense.

For example use well-known terminology from Schema.org - Schema.org combined with standard vocabularies about e-discovery.

## Message Names

Message names should be short and concise. Avoid unnecessary or redundant words. Adjectives can often be omitted if there is no corresponding message without the adjective. For example, the Shared in SharedProxySettings is unnecessary if there are no unshared proxy settings.

Message names should not include prepositions (e.g. "With", "For"). Generally, message names with prepositions are better represented with optional fields on the message

This help creates a standard and improves SEO and search.
By using well-know words it is more effortless for users to understand the API.
