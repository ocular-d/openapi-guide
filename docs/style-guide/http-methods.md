All resources have a set of methods that they support and that allow to manage the data they expose.
Each method allows for a unique type of action on the data.

Especially REStful APIs consist of HTTP methods which have well-defined and unique actions
that allow CRUD operations against resources.

Hereâ€™s a list of commonly used HTTP methods
that define the CRUD operations for any resource or collection in a RESTful API.

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ---------- |
| GET    | Retrieve a representation of a resource                            |
| POST   | Create new resources and sub-resources                             |
| PUT    | Update existing resources by overwriting their entire content      |
| PATCH  | Update existing resources by only modifying a part of the resource |
| DELETE | Used to delete existing resources                                  |

:::tip Difference between PUT and PATCH
It's important to understand the nuances between these two methods, as they have different consequences on a resource's content.

- A `PUT` request will replace the entire content of the resource at the location
- A `PATCH` request, on the other hand, is used to make changes to a part of the resource at a location
