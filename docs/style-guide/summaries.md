Summaries are also an important part of the API documentation because they are displayed in key parts of the navigation.
Users often use them to understand whether an endpoint or item is relevant to them,
so their goal is to hint at what the item is enabling users to do.

Follow these tips for summaries:

- Add summaries to endpoints
- Don’t repeat the name of the method in summary, if we talk about GET, don’t say Get all users (example)
- Wording should be as clear and self-explaining as possible
- Shorter is better
