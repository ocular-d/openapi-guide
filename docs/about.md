description: About this OpenAPI guide.

An API guide ensures consistency and usability, which are a must for a stunning experience.
It also ensures that API documentation makes sense for humans and machines alike.

## Why an API guide

Despite of what an API can technically do or not do, one of the terms that compose the acronym is "Interface".
An API is, at the end of the day, yet another interface.

Keeping users (replace with *consumers*) and usability at the core of your work around APIs is a must.

How does one remove friction from APIs and make them usable?

<!-- vale off -->

Because APIs only rely on words, consistency, examples, extensibility, and writing are of outmost importance.
In Agile teams, with several developers contributing to the same API, design guidelines that they can reference
become a great tool to ensure that a pleasant experience is created even if "it's just code".


The key is [adopting an outside-in perspective](https://stoplight.io/blog/why-you-should-view-your-apis-as-products/#1.-adopt-an-outside-in-perspective)
and putting yourself in the shoes of who uses your API all the time.

For these reasons, we put together a set of good practices and recommendations that,
if followed throughout the entire API lifecycle and regardless of the API type,
can ensure that the product is an API users love using.

Finally, getting an API experience right implies writing awesome code,
but also looking after additional documentation like getting started, tutorials, and more.
