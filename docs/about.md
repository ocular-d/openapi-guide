# About

Set of general rules and recommendations that have to be followed along the entire API lifecycle of any API regardless of its type.

We aim for the highest quality possible! The API and docs (API reference and additionally documentation like getting started, tutorials, etc) should be as clear and stunning as possible.

The API is your contract!
