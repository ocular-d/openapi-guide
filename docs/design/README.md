Your API design influences how well developers and systems can consume it and even how they use it

- Good API design meets initial expectations and continues to behave consistently and predictably

- A good public and internal API focuses on: Functionality, usability and creating a nice user experience

- A good system API focuses on: Functionality and usability

Put your audience first!

In general, an effective API design will have the following characteristics:

Easy to read and work with: A well-designed API will be easy to work with, and its resources and associated operations can quickly be memorized by developers who work with it constantly.

Hard to misuse: Implementing and integrating with an API with good design will be a straightforward process, and writing incorrect code will be a less likely outcome. It has informative feedback, and doesn’t enforce strict guidelines on the API’s end consumer.

Complete and concise: A complete API will make it possible for developers to make full- fledged applications against the data you expose. Completeness happens over time usually, and most API designers and developers incrementally build on top of existing APIs. It is an ideal which every engineer or company with an API must strive towards.

Explain parameters and values: A stunning API explains and documents parameters and values of endpoints in an effortless human understandable way.

# About

API design is the collection of planning and architectural decisions you make when building an API.

There is not a single approach to design APIs “the right way.”

## To do

Explain that we focus on APIs which are use by humans, add a note about different kinds of APIs, like public user API, internal API, system API

API first strategy?
