# Design first

## Adidas

Everyone MUST follow the API First principle.
The API first principle is an extension of contract-first principle. Therefore, a development of an API MUST always start with API design without any upfront coding activities.
API design (e.g., description, schema) is the master of truth, not the API implementation.
API implementation MUST always be compliant to particular API design which represents the contract between API, and it's consumer.

API First is the way to go, it makes things so much simpler, and it’s what OpenAPI was made for. When you start with an API spec, you can start building docs, tests and client/server code right away. It’s more than a contract; it’s more than just docs; it’s an interface you’re building with words.
