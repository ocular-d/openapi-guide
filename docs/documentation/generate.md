# Generate documentation

There are many tools you can use to generate documentation.
This article collects a few of them so that you can get an idea of which one is the best fit for you.

## ReDoc

## Swagger UI

[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.

It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it effortless for back end implementation and client side consumption.

:::warning Info
With Stoplight Elements you can use [Stoplight Flavored Markdown (SMD)](https://meta.stoplight.io/docs/studio/docs/Documentation/03a-stoplight-flavored-markdown.md) to enhance your Markdown.

By leveraging comments to store the annotations, Stoplight Flavored Markdown degrades gracefully when rendered in other CommonMark-compatible Markdown renderers (GitHub, for example).

## Widdershins

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->

Widdershins is generally used as a stage in an API documentation pipeline. The pipeline begins with an API definition in OpenAPI 3.x, OpenAPI 2.0 (fka Swagger), API Blueprint, AsyncAPI or Semoasa format.
Widdershins converts this description into Markdown suitable for use by a **renderer**, such as [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate), [ReSlate](https://github.com/mermade/reslate) or html suitable for use with [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec).

More in-depth documentation is [available on GitHub](https://mermade.github.io/widdershins).
