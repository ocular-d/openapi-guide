# How-To Tutorials

Tutorials are similar to getting started guides but are looking to make it easy to perform a particular use case.
You can create a tutorial folder, and add more articles to it covering extra topics as questions come in.

For example, things like pagination are somewhat covered in API Reference Documentation.
Maybe a query string parameter exists like `?page=1` or `?cursor=s24dfkjfhkdf`, and whilst some developers might understand that perfectly, many won't.

A tutorial for how pagination works for your API is a great place to explain why you chose your specific pagination approach of the many that exist, and explain how your users should interact with it.
E.g.: Slack and Stripe.

Other common tutorials are "Common Errors" which explain how your error objects work, what common status codes mean so you don't need to document `500`, `501`, `502` on every single operation, and any other useful information that can help users troubleshoot trouble.
