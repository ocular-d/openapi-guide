Even if you do the best API design, name your endpoints in a friendly and consistent way,
pick a common message format like JSON:API, and are using a popular authentication method like OAuth 2.0,
that won't be enough to get the users adopting and engaged with your API.

Even the best-designed APIs with the most robust references should provide a getting started guide
to point developers in the right direction.
Some may be new to many of the tools and standards you have chosen to use or even be new to APIs in general.

It's of outmost importance that your docs walk them through the most common tasks,
identify the steps to authenticate, and show off a step by step guide to bring them to their first "aha" moment -
usually creating a resource on the server or some other successful transaction.

Once you've written this guide, make it highly visible within your documentation.

By removing any possible obstruction between new developers and their first successful experience,
you'll have more successful integrations with your API,
which hopefully means happier users and a more healthy business.

An API is your contract with them!
