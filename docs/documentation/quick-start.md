Let's assume you've done a great job of designing your API, named your endpoints in a friendly and consistent way, picked a common message format like JSON:API, and are using a popular authentication method like OAuth 2.0.

That should be enough to get a developer started, right?

Maybe, maybe not.

Even the best designed APIs with the most robust references should provide a Getting Started Guide to point developers in the right direction.

Many developers may be new to many of the tools and standards you have chosen to use, they may even be new to consuming API's in general!

Walk them through the most common tasks, identify the steps to authenticate, and show off a step by step guide to help them get their first "aha" moment: usually creating a resource on the server, or some other successful transaction.

Once you've written this guide, make it highly visible within your documentation.

In removing any possible obstruction between new developers and their first successful experience, you'll have more successful integrations with your API, which hopefully means more money, or more happy users.

The API is your contract!
