Show developers how to move from documentation to code

This documentation focuses on all the endpoints (a.k.a "operations") available in an API, and helps explain potential input and output values that can be in requests and responses.

Some API reference documentation will just show an example, but it's more useful to expand upon that and explain not just what those values mean, but what other values could also be valid in various contexts.

If you don't already have an API description, get started by creating a new API design or convert some other machine-readable formats like RAML, HAL, or Postman, to OpenAPI with Apimatic Transformer.

This documentation is also where you show users which endpoints need which authentication methods (or security schemes), what cache headers they could expect to find, and even point out things like pagination.

Many of these topics would also make for a good tutorial too, to introduce the concepts and explain any gotchas or non-standard bits.
